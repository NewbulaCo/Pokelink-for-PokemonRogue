# What is this?

The PokeLink app is a tool to update your ingame Pokemon party to your OBS layout for streaming. However, PokeLink doesn't have much support for rom hacks, so I made these custom configs which allow it to work with Pokemon Emerald Rogue.

# How to Install
  - Prerequisites: [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), [Pokelink](https://assets.pokelink.xyz/dist/pokelink-0.6.1-win64.zip), [Pokemon Emerald Rogue](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=479406), [VBA](https://github.com/TASEmulators/vba-rerecording/releases), and the newest released Config for this project
  
  - Step 1: On the PokeLink app page, start a new Session, select Automatic Party Management, and select Pokemon Emerald.
  - Step 2: Load VBA, load Pokemon Emerald Rouge, then go to Tools > Lua Scripting > New Lua Script Window. Copy and paste the script directory into VBA as normal.
  - Step 3: Once loaded, hit "Stop" on the VBA script. Navigate to the PokeLink folder.
  - Step 4: Open *pokemonrogue-pokelink_vX.zip*, extract *'pokelink'* and merge it with the original PokeLink folder. Replace files as necessary.
  - Step 5: Hit "Run" on VBA.
